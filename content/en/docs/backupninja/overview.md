Using Elastx as a Backup Ninja cloud provider is easy, but there are a couple of prerequisites:

- You need to sign up for an OpenStack account, to sign up click [here](https://elastx.se/en/signup-openstack) and complete the form.
- Once you've got an OpenStack account you need to create EC2 credentials for use with Backup Ninja as described [here](https://docs.elastx.cloud/docs/openstack-iaas/guides/ec2_credentials/)

Thats it! Just follow the [Backup Ninja documentation](https://docs.severalnines.com/docs/backup-ninja/how-to/cloud-credentials/) to start using Elastx as a cloud storage provider.
